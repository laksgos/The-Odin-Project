    <h2>Donut</h2>
    <p1>Making homemade glazed doughnuts is easier than you think. Ready in about 2 hours, these taste like doughnuts from your favorite bakery, but they’re made in the comfort of your own home. For doughnut success, follow my step-by-step photos, helpful success tips, and foolproof recipe. Using this same doughnut dough, you can create other flavored frosted doughnuts too!    </p1>
    <p2>With that signature bakery taste and texture, doughnuts from a doughnut shop are incredibly delicious and indulgent. When you can’t pick up your favorite doughnuts, why not make them at home instead? Today we’re taking a deep dive into homemade doughnuts– fried, sugary, old-fashioned, and comforting. It’s so much fun to be able to make them from scratch without leaving the comforts of home.    </p2>
    <ul>
        <li>Dough</li>
        <li>oil</li>
        <li>sugary</li>
        <li>yeast</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Milk: Liquid activates the yeast. Whole milk is a must for the most tender dough– or you can try buttermilk. Lower fat or nondairy milks work in a pinch, but the doughnuts aren’t as flavorful or rich.</li>
        <li>Yeast: You can use active dry yeast or instant yeast. If using an instant yeast, your rise time will be a little shorter.</li>
        <li>Add the sauce to the Onions and Tomatoes</li>
        <li>Nutmeg: A little nutmeg is the secret ingredient to that cozy, comforting bakery taste. If you’ve ever made my chocolate chip muffins, you know it adds a delicious pop of flavor!
        </li>
        <li>Flour: All-purpose flour is the dough’s structure. You’ll be tempted to add more and more flour as you mix the dough, but don’t. You want a very soft, pillowy dough for soft, pillowy doughnuts. The dough can still be slightly sticky. When kneading, use extra flour on your hands and work surface.</li>
